In this class, we learned about the [[Extended Mind]]
- A philosophical idea which challenges traditional thinking that cognition only occurs within the brain
- Cognitive processes and states can extend beyond the confines of an individual's body through the incorporation of an extension
	- Cognitive extensions are objects, tools, or even other people which can be considered a part of cognition if they play a significant role in information processing, memory, problem solving, decision making, etc...
		- External cognitive resources in essence become an *extension of the mind*
